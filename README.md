# Ada_Application_Repo
A set of Python programs to solve problems in the Ada Developers Academy application.

There are three actual programs:

Ada_Storm_Free_Counties.py
Ada_8AM_to_11AM_CST.py
Ada_Louisiana_Purchase_states.py

These programs depend on three CSV files, also included in this repo:

StormEvents2007_trimmed.csv (listing of storm events in 2007, from [NOAA Database](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp), with last three columns removed to facilitate read-in)

1957_trimmed2.csv (listing of storm events in 1957, from [NOAA Database](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp), with last three columns trimmed to facilitate read-in)

Washington_Counties.csv (list of counties in Washington State, from the [Census 2010 website](http://data.spokesman.com/census/2010/washington/counties/))

These programs were written for an application for [Ada Developers Academy](http://adadevelopersacademy.org/).
